            BUILD AN API WITH DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK

0 - INTRODUCTION -
Application Programming Interface : defines how different software systems should interact
with each other by specifying the types of requests and responses that can be made as well as
the format of data being transferred

Web development context : API used to expose data and functionality from a web application
to other systems (mobile apps, other websites, IOT devices)

Example du restaurant : le client passe commande à la cuisine en passant par le serveur, qui
traite la demande pur une solution appropriée

API is capable of accepting and collecting different requests, and based of those requests,
it returns different and appropriate responses
